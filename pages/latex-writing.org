Use a spell checker

Use a grammar checker

Some frequent LaTeX mistakes:
   + Add an insecable space (=~=) in front of most =\cite{...}=.  For
     example: =Warren~\cite{Warren1965} was the first to...=.

If you use a version control system, e.g., =git=:
   + Write each sentence /on a single text line/.
     + A long text line probably indicates that the sentence is too long
       and needs to be written differently.
     + It helps to keep track of word changes accross revisions.
   + Don't use your editor's reformatting tools.
     + For example, considering this short example:
#+begin_example
This section presents the existing works that investigate approaches
to evaluate...
#+end_example
     ...  Adding the word /new/ to the sentence, combined with editor reformating,  modifies /two/ text lines where a single word modification was done in the text.
#+begin_example
This section presents the existing works that investigate new
approaches to evaluate...
#+end_example

Typography:
   + For the French typography, read the [[https://catalogue.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb38887921n.public][Lexique des règles typographiques en usage à l'Imprimerie nationale]].
     + French uses insecable spaces before many punctuations,
       e.g., =?=, =!=, =:=, =;=, =»= (hence, also after =«=).
       + For example: =«~Salut, la compagnie~!~»=

   + For the English typography and many other topics related to writing,
     read the [[https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/product/Fowler-Little-Brown-Handbook-The-14th-Edition/9780134759722.html][Little, Brown Handbook]].
     + English does /not/ use insecable spaces before punctuation
       marks.
       + For example: ="Hello, World!"=
