Here is the list of my (public) pet projects, or former software projects I
have contributed to.

+ [[http://obnam.org/][obnam]] - a backup program capable of data de-duplication together with
  client-side encryption
+ [[http://sousmonlit.zincube.net/~niol/playa/oss/projects/lazygal][lazygal]] - a static web gallery generator written in Python


TODO update this list.
