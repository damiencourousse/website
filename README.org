** setup

Image processing relies on the binary program =convert=, from
=imagemagick=.  The built program that generates the static website
assumes that the binary =convert= is available somewhere in user's
path; it will crash without warning if it is not the case!

** build

This builds a static website.  All the website files are pushed in the
subdirectory =_site=.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
make
#+END_EXAMPLE

To force a full rebuild:
#+begin_example
$ make rebuild
#+end_example

** watch

The build rule =watch= loads the built static website in a local web
server, and automatically rebuilds the target files when changes are
detected in the source files.

#+begin_example
$ make watch
#+end_example

** push the built website files

The subdirectory =site= is a git submodule.  Its contents are synced
from the contents of subdirectory =_site=.  The purpose of the =site=
submodule is to be pushed on remote repository services such as github
pages, for hosting static websites.
